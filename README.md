Speaker: Leonardo HernÃ¡ndez

Leo began defining what is UX (user experience) and invited us to *Design thinking*
## UX design from scratch

UX involve all our senses as possible when we test a service or a product; and it focus in provide a relevant experience. 
UX practitioners are interested in the relationship human-product or human-service, in our case human-computer (software). And we need to make us some questions
we could be developing some web apps in a soon future and is important consider if...
1. Does the site or application give the user value?
2. Does the user find the site or application to use and navigate?
3. Does the user actually enjoy using the site (or application)?

Is too important work in harmony with our product owner and stakeholders, because they know their needs, or not maybe, but in team we are going to find them.

## User centered design process (UCD)
> Designers focus on the users and their needs 

UCD is design process (not the only one).

As Wikipedia said:

> Is a framework of processes in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product (service or process) is given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.

## Steps
### 1. Innovation
Ideas generation
### 2. Research (understanding users)
* What do you think of your ideas?
* What do they think could be improved?
* Would they use your idea in principle?
* How would they use that idea?
* What do your users want (need) from the product (service)?
*What are the pain points that your users are experiencing that your product (service) cures?
### 3. [Use cases](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/useCaseDiagram.htm) (Defining interactions)
